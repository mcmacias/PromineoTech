        listed the dates I read them, as well as given them a star review and a short review as to
        what I thought about it. I will also update a month after reading the book becuase opinions
        tend to change after putting it down for a few days.

      <h6 className="read-table-info">This TBR list is pretty straight forward. I have listed the title and author, 
        as well as the dates I read them, the rating I would give it (out of 5 stars), and a short review about my 
        final thoguhts on the book.
