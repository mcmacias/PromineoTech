      <h5 className="tbr-intro">TBR books are "To Be Read" books. This is mainly a list of books that you 
      are interesed in picking up (hopefully in the near future). This can also include any physical books 
      that you own that are still sitting on your shelves waiting to be picked up. TBR books (especailly the
      physical piles) have a reputation amonst readers of a list that will never be fully completed, since we 
      tend to add more to our TBR even as much or more than what we are reading. </h5>

      <h6 className="tbr-table-info">This TBR list is pretty straight forward. I have listed the title and author, as well as three reasons 
        why I have included this book to my tbr. I have also added a line for series (so I can add more books if 
        I enjoy any series).
